As you see, the blind master cannot see anything, literally.  

# How To Play

Press WASD to move forward/backward/left/right.  
Enemies' attack will make sounds from a direction. You need to dodge or deflect.  
To successfully dodge, move away from where the sounds come from (e.g. sound from left, dodge right/front/back are all ok)  
You can deflect blade by pressing R. However, you cannot deflect everything.  
When you encounter an apparently undeflectable attack, just dodge.  
To quit the game, press Q.  

* To play this game, wearing a good headphone or earphone is better.
